# ULTRAKILL TAS MOD

Hello!

Made by DolfeLive

Some Notes:

Replays are not always going to be 100% accurate this isn't a instant replay mod it's a tool to create perfect runs so some extra work has too be done to make it work

The TAS files are saved under ULTRAKILL/BepInEx/config/UltraTAS/
the TAS file structure is the

DOLF{number}
number = the frame the actions are under
then

X{numbers}
Y{numbers}

numbers = the X and Y rotation of the camera

Then if there is a input:
Fire1 = Main shoot
Fire2 = Secondary

"Jump"
"Dodge"
"Slide"
"Punch"
"Hook"
"LastUsedWeapon"
"ChangeVariation"
"ChangeFist"
"Slot1"
"Slot2"
"Slot3"
"Slot4"
"Slot5"
"Slot6"

W
S
A
D

WSAD are the movement inputs name so say you have x,c,v,b as your movement they are still named under w, s, a and d.

The Console When recoding a TAS prints the:
Frame: {frame}
Then the actions you are doing

Some things don't fully work like dashing in the direction you are facing due to how the libraries I am using to simulate key presses work


Replaying is the same as recoding in how the console works

You have the keybinds to: 
Pause time:  Default = P
Advance a frame (while time is paused): Default = O
Start Recoding TAS: Default = K
Play TAS: Default = M

Tell me @dolfelive if you want more features

Please ASK Permission to further distruibute
The Mods you NEED is currently configgy and the .dll's included and the WindowsInput.pdb and WindowsInput.xml

Have fun TAS'ing
